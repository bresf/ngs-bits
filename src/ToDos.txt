=== TODO ===

libs:
* FilterGenotypeAffected: exclude comp-het variant pairs, that are present in one or more controls
- The call of "resizeColumnsToContents()" in "GUIHelper::resizeTableCells" is slow for large tables. Maybe we can re-implement it to use only the top x lines only?!

NGSD:
** Allow adding study details:
    - table study:
        - id: INT, autoincrement
        - name: TEXT not null, unique //GenomeFirst, Solve-RD, Neuromics, GMed
        - description: TEXT
   - table study_sample:
        - id: INT not null, autoincrement
        - processed_sample_id: INT not null
        - study_id: INT not null
        - study_sample_idendifier: TEXT not null
        - comment: TEXT
* Implement "closing gaps by sanger"
    - select gaps to close in gap dialog > write to NGSD table (sample_id>sample, enum status: 'to close', 'in progress', 'closed', requested_by>user, comment)
    - make page where TA can select gaps (by gene/DX number)
        - also allow copying multiple gaps into clipboard (as table and for primer gap)
        - add link for PrimerDesign tool
- Sample: allow several disease_groups per sample (requested by CS)
- add multi-sample report-config
    - 1 affected > easy
    - >1 affected > how? edit all or ask which to edit?
    - no report needed - is created from individual samples

GSvar:
## Prferred transcripts: allow deleting
## ACMG filter: +LOW +HGMD +likely_pathogenic
## Tabs: do not close tabs when opening a new GSvar file. Open a tab only once - focus and update if opened again.
## Allow adding variant outside of target region to report
    - add checkboxes to variants in report dialog
    - checkboxes for variants in ROI are checked and disabled
    - checkboxes for variants ouside or ROI are unchecked and enabled
    - only variants which are checked are added to the report config
* Trio report: force disease_group/disease_status and outcome (import trio parents as unaffected with same disease group as child)
* Allow ClinVar upload
    - small variants and CNVs
    - only flag variants and perform manual upload at the end of each quater
    - use XML format: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/clinvar/ClinVarDataDictionary.pdf (see also email 'Programm fÃ¼r AG Genom-Informatik')
** allow creating somatic report and XML-export for tumor-only - after tumor-normal is done (AG)

Tools:
- UPDHunter: also support chrX?
- SomaticQC: replace 'QC:?' by real qcML identifier - add to https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC (CS)

External:
#### implement MultiQC support for ReadQC/MappingQC/VariantQC/SomaticQC (>JM): /mnt/SRV018/users/ahmattj1/dev/MultiQC/venv3/bin/multiqc -m readqc -m mappingqc -m variantqc .

RohHunter:
- exclude CNP regions?
- optimize quality cutoffs based on variants that are het on chrX for males (AF, DP, MQM, blacklist, InDels, no AF annotation, homopolymer region,...)
- test splitting regions when dist is too high, e.g. > 100Kb => Q-score cutoff removes random parts?!
- test input of high-cov ROI to augment the input data with WT SNPs with AF>1-5%
- test if sub-population AF improves result
- benchmarks: chrX of males, add errors up to 2 percent, overlap WGS/WES


Features to dicuss:
- Add family table linking samples in one family with "father", "mother", "child", "aunte", "cousin", ... OR import samples relations from GenLab?? > FLORIAN/LUCIA/TOBIAS
- Add liquid handler robot to processed sample talbe > FLORIAN/LAB/TOBIAS
- Correctly import sample sender data from GenLab > TOBIAS/STEPHAN O.
- CAVE functionality for Genes (use e.g. for imprinting), model reasons? > SWAL
